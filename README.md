# a11y-automation

This app is a work in progress.

This is an Ember app, which  means you'll need to have Ember installed (`npm install -g ember-cli`) to contribute. Contributions are welcome, and come in many different flavors: 

- filing bugs
- filing new feature requests (such as a new criteria)
- submitting a PR to resolve an issue
- improving the README or other files of this type


## Add a new criteria item

To add a new criteria file, you can add one manually, or you can use the generator to generate the file and put it in the correct location- `ember generate criteria my-criteria-name`.
