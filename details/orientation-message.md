## Point of Failure
A message should not be shown that asks the user to change the orientation of the device.

## Automation

### Linting
Potentially automatable through CSS linting.

### Testing
Potentially automatable but needs further analysis. 

### Developer Authored Test
TBD

### Manual Test
Rotate the device and ensure that a message does not appear to ask you to change your device's orientation.
