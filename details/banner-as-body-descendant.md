## Point of Failure
Description goes here.

## Automation

### Linting
Cannot Exist Yet. If you have any ideas about how this could be done, please [file an issue on this app's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MelSumner/a11y-automation/issues).

### Testing
See the [`axe-core`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) library for the `landmark-banner-is-top-level` rule.

### Developer Authored Test
Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test
Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
