## Point of Failure
Images of text should not be used as headings.

## Automation

### Linting
Potentially automatable but there are a lot of details to consider. 
- how do we programmatically identify images of text
- how do we programmatically identify headings
- how do we programmatically identify that an image of text is being used as a header

### Testing
See above

### Developer Authored Test
TBD

### Manual Test
Review the page. Check headings to insure they are not images of text.
