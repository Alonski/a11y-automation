## Automation

### Linting
Cannot exist yet. How would you programmatically identify something as a character count so an automated linting check could occur?

### Testing
see above

### Developer Authored Test
Developers should ensure that their code does not violate this rule, and write a test that prevents regressions in code if it is later changed.

### Manual Test
