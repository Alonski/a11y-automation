## Point of Failure
The character counts for `<input>` elements should be made available to screen readers.

## Automation

Cannot exist yet. How would you programmatically identify something as a character count so an automated linting check could occur?

### Testing
see above

### Developer Authored Test
TBD

### Manual Test
TBD
