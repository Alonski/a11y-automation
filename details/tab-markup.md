## Point of Failure
Elements used as tabs should be marked with the correct roles

## Automation

### Linting
How could we programmatically determine that a UI component is being used as a tab, unless it already had the correct roles to indicate such? 

### Testing
See above. 

### Developer Authored Test
TBD

### Manual Test
Review page and ensure the point of failure does not exist, inspecting the DOM where required.
